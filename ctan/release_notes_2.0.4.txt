The changes-package allows the user to manually markup changes of text, such as additions, deletions, or replacements.
Changed text is shown in a different color; deleted text is striked out.
The package allows free defining of additional authors and their associated color.
It also allows you to change the markup of changes, authors, or annotations.

Release 2.0.4 is a bugfix release fixing the following problem: the changes package produced
a LaTeX error when used with an unknown language.

Please inform me about any errors or improvements as you see fit.
