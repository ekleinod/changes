The changes-package allows the user to manually markup changes of text, such as additions, deletions, or replacements.
Changed text is shown in a different colour; deleted text is striked out.
The package allows free defining of additional authors and their associated colour.
It also allows you to change the markup of changes, authors, or annotations.

Release 2.0.0 changes the output of the list of changes.
Default is a list similar to the list of tables or figures.
The summary of v1.* can be achieved using \listofchanges[style=summary].
Several bugfixes were introduced as well.
See version info in documentation for more information.

Please inform me about any errors or improvements as you see fit.
